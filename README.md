# VisualizationRedesign
This project was built in Google Colab as a redesign proposal for https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/bluedot-observatory-keeping-an-eye-on-our-planets-water-resources/. The project observes surface area of various dams and reseviors over time. It is built with data from "Future dams" (FHReD 2015, beta version, linked here https://www.globaldamwatch.org/fhred/) and simulated data. 

To run it, download both files and put them in the same directory. Run visualizationRedesign.ipynb.
