# VisualizationRedesign
This project was built in Google Colab as a redesign proposal for https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/bluedot-observatory-keeping-an-eye-on-our-planets-water-resources/. The project observes surface area of various dams and reseviors over time. It is built with data from "Future dams" (FHReD 2015, beta version, linked here https://www.globaldamwatch.org/fhred/) and simulated data. 

To run this project, first install all the packages in requirements.txt if you haven't already. Download app.py and betterdamdata.csv, making sure they are in the same file. In your terminal, navigate to the folder with the files and run streamlit run app.py. 

Alternatively, the visualization can be accessed here: https://visualizationredesign-az3nrfsd589rbvs8djehyb.streamlit.app/

This project contributes to the clean water and sanitation goal, by helping monitor water sources around the world. Keeping an eye on these water sources ensures that we are able to take action if they are endangered.
